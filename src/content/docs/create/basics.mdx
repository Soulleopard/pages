## Blood

Provides **Health**, **Attributes** and **Innate Skills**. The Realm hosts the bloodline of many. Of every shape, size and sense. **Blood** also writes the parameters of one's **Visage**.

## Vocation

Describes one's favored ways of interacting with the world. Not comprehensive to one's potential, but a rubric for navigating the Realm. Each with their own strengths, weaknesses and opportunity. There are three considerations to ponder:

How does one come to be this way? By choice or circumstance?

Which skills appear most valuable: Combat prowess? Social cunning? Wealth of Knowledge?

Would one place themselves between their allies and danger? Or prefer to engage enemies and support allies from a distance?

**Vocation** provides a choice. Choose two *available* **Skills** to gain. Note a **Attribute** **Focuses** as a suggestion. To obtain initial **Attribute** values, roll **4d6** and record the result *ignoring the lowest die*. Repeat this roll a total of *six* times, then assign one of the values to each **Attribute**.

## Background

Serves as a foundation for **Goals** and **Ideals**. Additionally, the **Background** may justify up to **2 Skills** in addition to any existing skills (most often tied to one's chosen weapons).

Lastly, define one or more **Bonds** and **Flaws**. Each of these electives tie one to the **Realm** and its other inhabitants. Additionally they outline one's key behavior. Cowardice, kleptomania or wanderlust. Fear of fire, solitude or spirits etc. Make choices which one may embrace with heart.
