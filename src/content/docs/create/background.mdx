Your Avatar's background provides a foundation for many of their traits and capabilities as well as reason for their presence in the campaign setting. Backgrounds are often archetypal but may have a vast degree of variance between two of the same background.

## Acolyte

Your Acolyte thusfar dedicated life to a deity or pantheon. Many years of service within a temple or monastery executing the wishes of powers above. Not necessarily drawn to the commitment of a Cleric, Monk, or Paladin, but inseparable from the beliefs of their upbringings.

<Tabs client:load>
    <Tab name="Goals">
        Idolize a hero of the faith and seek to mimic their exploits and accolades.
        
        Acting always as a missionary, believing to possess some salvation for all they meet.
        
        In the face of an unwavering commitment to the creed, still they see a need for change in its doctrine. Travels far and wide attempting to turn others of their faith to a new leaf.
    </Tab>
    <Tab name="Ideals">
        Tradition. Ancient practices served to deliver ages of life to the realm, and they need be honored.

        Charitability. It is the duty of the great to help the needing. The more one is able to give the greater they become.

        Power. Their faith is the source of their power, and they wish to exist as a living testament to the greatness of their faith.
    </Tab>
    <Tab name="Bonds">
        They life is forever in debt to the Cleric or Monk who saved them and took them in within the order of the temple.

        They come from a simple and poor upbringing before the faith. Everything they do is in honor of the common folk.

        They would give their life to recover a lost sacred artifact of their faith to the temple where they grew up.
    </Tab>
    <Tab name="Flaws">
        The structures on which they rely in morality lead them to inflexible and stubborn thinking.

        They are obsessed with their truths and would blindly follow them into danger.

        They are brutally suspicious and judgmental of others, and hypocritical of their own mistakes.
    </Tab>

## Charlatan

No amount of trickery or false pretense is too much to turn a quick coin. The skills to distract, deceive and entertain run through your veins. Why live a life committed to the arts of the arcane or the worship of gods when a simple turn the palm may appear just as magical? Besides it leaves all that time of study and labor open for bacchanalian exploits.

<Tabs client:load>
    <Tab name="Goals">
        Amass such vast wealth that your Charlatan can leave their life of falsehood behind.

        Repay the vast debt which has hung over your Charlatan's head for as long as they can remember.

        Finally break free from the busking and pickpocketing by landing a true role and title. Become a name for the Realm to remember.
    </Tab>
    <Tab name="Ideals">
        The ends justify the means. You fall for it, you pay the price.

        Fairness. Take from the rich to give to the poor, and never make a target of the innocent.

        Aspiration. Truly wishes to make something of themselves but cannot help but take shortcuts and pull tricks.
    </Tab>
    <Tab name="Bonds">
        Your Charlatan fleeced the wrong person. A powerful person. They'll do anything not to cross paths with them again.

        Your Charlatan owes all they learned to their mentor. A terrible person who's likely rotting in jail somewhere.

        Your Charlatan was once prosperous and honest, but that was all torn away from them. Revenge is in order.
    </Tab>
    <Tab name="Flaws">
        Your Charlatan is convinced they are the fooler, and never the fooled. Gullible and full of themselves to the core.

        Forever greedy and a big spender. Cannot resist the wish for riches, no matter the risk. Yet the money never sticks around for long.

        After getting caught in a lie so many times, your Charlatan has gotten used to running away when the pressure is on.

## Failed Merchant

Whether you come from a long line of merchants or bootstraps entrepreneur, your Merchant's last venture failed miserably. Bad luck, unfavorable markets or just plain poor business acumen, its all fallen apart and left them with nothing. Nonetheless, lessons were learned and connections made which is certainly worth something. Onward to a life of adventure with the past behind you.

<Tabs client:load>
    <Tab name="Goals">
        Your Merchant has an incredible debt to repay. Someone dear put their faith in the business, and they still don't know the truth.

        Your Merchant has decided there is only one path forward: Redemption. Time to make your name known for greatness. Not failure.

        One door closed is another open. If mushroom farming wasn't your Merchant's forte, the business of adventure is up next.
    </Tab>
    <Tab name="Ideals">
        Generosity. Even when you have little, whats yours is to be shared with friends. A trait which does not always translate in business.

        Bargaining. You believe there is a deal to be struck with anyone and live for the craft of negotiating.

        Optimism. Despite all your Merchant's hardships, they refuse to let their chin fall.
    </Tab>
    <Tab name="Bonds">
        Your Merchant had a business partner. After realizing your great failure, they disappeared without a goodbye.

        The last piece of your franchise is the first item you ever acquired. You'll cherish it until its pried from your cold dead hands.

        Your Merchant's failure were their own. A great mentor had always tried to advise them. Might be worth seeking out just once more.
    </Tab>
    <Tab name="Flaws">
        Your Merchant has decided they failed one way only: Not cutthroat enough. Not a mistake they'll make again.

        The truth is, your Merchant really just wants what others have. And willing to pay anything for it.

        Your Merchant is in some pretty heavy denial.

## Folk Hero

A humble hero from a place with few names. One whose selfless nature and bravery in the face of danger inspires all around them. Or perhaps a much more unlikely hero who nonetheless inspires awe amongst their peers. Or even a dark and shadowy monster slayer who liberated the townsfolk from the beast's tyranny.

<Tabs client:load>
    <Tab name="Goals">
        Your Hero stood up for their home with good reason. No place better! They're here to put their hometown on the map.

        The kingdom may have been saved, but it remains a poor kingdom wanting for much. Your Hero aims to return home with the treasures of adventure to share with all.

        Your Hero's greatest deed will not be the last. Another kingdom, somewhere out there, needs them.
